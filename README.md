# SA. 02 Phase 2 Code Challenge: Bot Battlr

Create a repository on your GitHub account.


Use JavaScript and Html to wire down the solution.

Push the solution to the above repository once done.

Submit the repository link for grading.

Ensure your repository has a well written README.

#### By **{List of contributors}**
This project was created and is sole property of Annglorious mueni.

### Instructions
- For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a

list of available bots, among other features. Try your best to find the right

places to insert code into the established code base.

- Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given

instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in

how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for

setting up the application.

### Requirements
* For this project, you must:

- Have a well-written README file.
- Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server. 
- The instructions below will walk you through the process of ideation and planning your app: deciding on your user interface, planning how the information will be laid out on the page, etc. You should work through all the planning steps before you start doing any coding.

Welcome to **Bot Battlr**, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army! This is our app:

Here's the scenario: a galactic overlord has hired you, a galactic web developer, to develop a galactic web app that will allow them to browse through a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army.

### Project Setup
Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

Create a new project folder.
Create a new GitHub repository.(NB: ENSURE IT IS PRIVATE).
Add your TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading purposes.)
Please make sure you regularly commit to the repository.
In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this dataLinks to an external site. for your server DB.
Run this command to get the backend started:
json-server --watch db.json

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:
http://localhost:8001/bots

### Project Guidelines
Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

### Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.

- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should

  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.

  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.

- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the

  `YourBotArmy` component.

- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked

  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the

  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.



### Advanced Deliverables
These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have

the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to

stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure to have a working project, and commit all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking

  on the card should instead display a show view (`BotSpecs`) for that bot,

  which should replace `BotsCollection`. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one

  to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot. Your app could

  look like the following:

- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,

  `SortBar`.

- When I enlist a bot it will be **removed** from the `BotCollection` and added

  to `YourBotArmy`.

- Filter bots by their class. We can select a few filters at the same time.

- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,

  `SortBar`.

- Only enlist **one** bot from each `bot_class`. The classes are

  `["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"]`.



## Setup/Installation Requirements
* One would need either linux or wsl for window users
* A copy of visual basic code installed
* A github account

1. Open your terminal and go to the directory you wish to work from.
2. Go to the following url using ur github account https://github.com/ANNGLORIOUS/code-challenge-2
3. Go to the code tab and clone the ssh key
4. Go back to the termina and type git clone <-followed by the ssh key you copied /cloned ->
5. Enter your new cloned repository and type in code .
6. On the visual studio code that has now opened, go to the the run tab and hit start debugging.
## Technologies Used
This program is built purely with react js (javascript ,html and css) using the visual code environment.
